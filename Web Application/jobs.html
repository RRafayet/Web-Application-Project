<p><em>Computer system managers need to spend the majority of their time in an office, 
work a minimum of 40 hours a week, and often work evening and weekends to resolve disputes and meet deadlines. 
Because of short deadlines and small budgets, managers responsible for the technical goals of their organization
 will be under significant stress. System managers must be able to effectively communicate using emails and the internet, 
 and supervise offsite employees, because more work is performed remotely. These managers are vulnerable to health problems such as back pain, 
 carpal tunnel syndrome, and eyestrain since they spend a majority of their in front of a computer.</em></p></section>
